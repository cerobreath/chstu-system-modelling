# System Modelling Labs and Calculation graphic work

This repository contains laboratory and computational-graphical works for the **System Modelling** course at Chernihiv Polytechnic National University. The projects focus on developing simulations, statistical analysis, and visualization of various system models using **Java (Swing, Simulation framework)** and other relevant tools.  

### **Features:**  
- **Graphical simulations** with Swing and custom components  
- **Statistical analysis** of random distributions  
- **Histograms & data visualization** for model evaluation  
- **Simulation experiments** to test hypotheses  

Each project includes structured code, detailed documentation, and implementation of key system modelling techniques.  

- **Language:** Java  
- **Frameworks:** Swing, Simulation
- **University:** Chernihiv Polytechnic National University
